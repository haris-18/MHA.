            <h1>Hi, It's <span>Haris</span></h1>
            <h3 class="typing-text">I'm a <span></span></h3>
            <p><br> Me for the love of Programming has made my own website as project no. "1"</br>
                I’m a student with a passion for coding and technology. Currently pursuing my high-level studies,
                along with trying to expand my skills and knowledge in programming and software development.
               <br> As I delve into the world of coding, I’ve been working on various projects that challenge me to
                think critically and creatively. My interests include: working on programming language such as python
                and frameworks and I’m always eager to learn more about web development and app development,
                other than that, beside tech interests I have a hobby to play badminton and cricket in college and out,
                as well as playing various battleground games.<br>Moreover, thier is a crave for cars in me and the obsession I have for them is undescribable, my personal favourite is Porsche 911 GT3 RS 
                which has a 4.0-liter high-revving naturally aspirated engine with 518 hp and 0-62 mph acceleration in 3.2 seconds and a top speed of 184 mph. Hence, cars probably are the top priority of mine.</p></br>
